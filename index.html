			<p>
				Lebanese student in Paris, trilingual therefore easily integrated. Currently in the first year of management at Ieseg School of Management.
				Being foreign in France and keeping in mind 
				the tragic situation of my country, I have 
				adopted a certain maturity and acquired various responsibilities.

			<h2>Hard worker</h2>
			<p>
				Foreigner and arriving from a country at war, I adapt and I manage to live on my own. Working is therefore part of my daily life, in parallel with my classes. 
				Thus, I have been working for a year in a Lebanese caterer located in the 17th arrondissement of Paris.

			<h2>Art</h2>
			<p>
				Since I was a child, I have been an artistic person who often stood out in visual arts classes. Indeed, I draw and paint very well. I have won several Fabriano awards and my most beautiful drawings are proudly displayed in my home. I hope to have the opportunity to exploit this skill in my future job.

			<h2>Adaptive and stoic</h2>
			<p>
				Having changed culture and country, and living alone in Paris, I experienced a culture shock. This experience has forged and strengthened my personality. Today I am someone who adapts to changes. In addition, I meet and integrate into cultural diversity. I feel that these personality traits will be useful to me in my professional life.
